Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems 
its importance is that it enables creation of software application systems that power various aspects of modern life including commerce, communication, entertainment and healthcare 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
development of programming languages like fortran,C
the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
the advent of structured programming in the 1970s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements; gathering amd documenting user needs and system requirements 
design;creating high level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface 
implementation; writing codes and building the software according to the design specifications 
testing;involves conducting various test to make sure the software meets quality standards 
deployment;involves releasing the software product to the users whoch are the customers 
maintenance ; providing support, update and enhancements to the software after deployment 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is the sequential approach with distinct phases flowing down like a waterfall from requirements,design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance example of softwares built this way are Microsoft windows 3.1 while agile methodologies uses iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change examples are Spotify, Instagram, Twitter 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer;writes codes and implements software solutions 
quality assurance engineer;ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans 
Project manager;oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs-provides comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing codes example video studio
VCS-tool for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members example is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
change requirements during development cycle which leads to scope creep and project delays; it can be solved by using waterfall methodologies to avoid delays in the project which normally leads to change of the languages
tight deadlines; pressure to deliver products on schedule results in rushed development leading to compromise quality and thus making maintenance cost expensive; there should be no pressure to limit the developers but he or she should have ample time

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing involves testing individual component or module of software. Integration testing involves testing interaction between different components or subsystem. system testing involves testing the entire system software. acceptance testing is testing software to ensure that it meets user requirements 
Quality control measures such as code reviews,automated testing and continuous integration helps identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to high quality software
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statement to get the best possible responses from AI models
it helps you get the best responses from your AI model

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt- give me an image of people fishing
improved - give me an image of two people fishing in a sea with a boat and they have fish with them
the improved prompt is more effective because it is clear, specific and concise.
